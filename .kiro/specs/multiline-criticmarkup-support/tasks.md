  - Verify preview renders correctly
  - Test with patterns containing empty lines
  - _Requirements: All_

- [x] 6. Update documentation
  - Update README.md to mention multi-line support
  - Add examples of multi-line patterns
  - Document any limitations or known issues
  - _Requirements: All_

- [x] 7. Fix mid-line multi-line pattern support
  - Modify `mdmarkupBlock` function in `src/preview/mdmarkup-plugin.ts` to detect patterns starting mid-line
  - Current implementation only checks if line starts with pattern markers
  - Need to scan entire line content, not just the beginning
  - Ensure block-level rule captures patterns regardless of position on line
  - Test with patterns that start after other text on the same line
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 7.1 Write property test for mid-line multi-line patterns
  - **Property 5: Mid-line multi-line pattern recognition**
  - Generate random text before and after multi-line patterns
  - Verify patterns are recognized regardless of position on line
  - Test with navigation, preview, and syntax highlighting
  - **Validates: Requirements 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 5.1, 5.3, 5.4**

- [x] 7.2 Add unit tests for specific mid-line cases
  - Test pattern starting mid-line with text before
  - Test pattern starting mid-line with text before and after
  - Test multiple patterns on same line
  - Test mid-line pattern followed by another pattern on next line
  - _Requirements: All_


## Implementation Notes

### Task 7: Mid-line Multi-line Pattern Support

Task 7 was initially implemented to support multi-line mdmarkup patterns that start mid-line (after other text on the same line). However, after implementation and testing, we discovered fundamental limitations:

1. **TextMate Grammar Limitations**: VS Code's TextMate engine has inherent limitations with multi-line pattern highlighting that cannot be easily overcome.

2. **Markdown-it Complexity**: Handling mid-line multi-line patterns in markdown-it requires complex text splitting and paragraph management that interacts unpredictably with other markdown syntax (blockquotes, lists, etc.).

3. **Partial Success**: The implementation successfully enabled navigation commands to work with mid-line patterns, but preview rendering and syntax highlighting remained problematic.

**Decision**: After discussion, we decided to **revert the complex implementation** and instead:
- Keep the simpler, more maintainable code that only handles patterns starting at line beginning
- Document the limitation clearly in README and design docs
- Maintain the navigation functionality which already works correctly for all patterns

**Current State**:
- ✅ Navigation commands work for all patterns (including mid-line multi-line)
- ✅ Preview rendering works for patterns starting at line beginning
- ❌ Preview rendering limited for mid-line multi-line patterns (documented limitation)
- ❌ TextMate syntax highlighting has inherent limitations (documented)

The code was simplified back to the original working approach, with added documentation about the limitations. This provides a better balance between functionality, code maintainability, and user expectations.
