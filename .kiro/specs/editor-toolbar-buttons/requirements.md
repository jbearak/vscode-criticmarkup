# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds toolbar buttons to the VS Code editor title bar that provide quick access to the existing "Markdown Annotations" and "Markdown Formatting" submenus. Currently, these menus are only accessible via right-click context menu. Adding toolbar buttons will improve discoverability and provide faster access to frequently-used mdmarkup and Markdown formatting commands.
