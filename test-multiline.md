# Multi-line mdmarkup Test

This is a test to see if multi-line markup works:

{++This is an addition
that spans multiple
lines++}

{--This is a deletion
that spans multiple
lines--}

{~~This is old text
that spans lines~>This is new text
that also spans lines~~}

{>>This is a comment
that spans multiple
lines<<}

{==This is a highlight
that spans multiple
lines==}

## Test with empty lines

{++This is an addition

with an empty line in the middle++}

{--This is a deletion

with an empty line--}

{~~Old text

with empty line~>New text

also with empty line~~}

## Test with empty patterns

{++++}
